title: Become a Contributer

<h1>So you wanna be a SWG Dev, eh?</h1>
<p>Great! We want to have you on board! The best place to start would be on our <a href="https://discord.gg/Va8e6n8" target="_blank">Discord</a> channel. That's where the community hangs out and it's the best place to ask questions and become familiar with the platform and with the codebase.</p>
<h2>Are you a programmer?</h2>
<p>If you want to start right now, feel free to fork our repos and try your hand at restoring something. You can then make a pull request to have your edits merged. We're also willing to give write access to contributers, so please introduce yourself in Discord. We want to meet you!</p>
<h2>Not so much with the programming?</h2>
<p>That's ok! You should join our Discord too. We can never have too many eyes looking for bugs. Bug reporting is a great way to contribute, and we appreciate them. You can also help with documentation. This website is written with Jekyll on GitHub Pages, which means that you can add a guide simply by adding a markdown file to the repository. Writing a guide is also a great way to learn something more throroughly.</p>
<p>Whatever your skill level, you're welcome in our community. Jump onto Discord and get involved!</p>
